# Database-Management-Projects
This project is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Database System built using MySQL. It is designed to demonstrate how relational databases can manage core CRM functionalities such as:

  Customer Management: Store and organize customer details for easy access.
  Lead Tracking: Monitor potential clients and their progress through the sales pipeline.
  Sales Representative Management: Assign tasks and track performance of sales reps.
  Product Catalog & Orders: Maintain product details, manage orders, and calculate totals.
  Interactions: Log communication history (calls, emails, meetings) with leads.
  Task Management: Schedule and track tasks for follow-ups and sales activities.

Key Highlights:

  Normalized Schema: Includes tables for customers, leads, products, orders, order items, interactions, and tasks.
  Sample Data: Pre-generated dataset with 100+ rows across all tables for testing and analytics.
  Compatibility: Schema avoids ENGINE=InnoDB and AUTO_INCREMENT for flexibility with any MySQL storage engine.
  Realistic Data: Names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates modeled on real-world patterns.
  Reporting Queries: Includes examples for lead pipeline, product sales, and task distribution.
